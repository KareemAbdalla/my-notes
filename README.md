I'm a fresh graduate majoring in computer science, I seek opportunity in a reputable institution where I can enhance my skills and gain professional knowledge

## Lesson learned from reading the article
What i learned is this having a very good attitude, understanding what clients and product owners want you to do, always trying to get better, and thinking before acting
can make you not only a better software developer but in whatever you want to do in your life
Here are some of the fundemntals that got my attention the most and why is that.

1- Concieving the purpose of software : Imagine spending days and days writing a software that will not meet te requirments
2- Running away from rewriting : i'v always thought the copy and paste is the way. well not anymore
3- Misunderstanding : for me this is one of the most importnant point in the article because the best developer can spend hours and hours writing something the client did nort ask for.
4- Productivity : What i learned through my life is work smart not hard.
5- Self Develoment : Nobody will care about you more than you.
6- Don't ask questions ask for help : Sometimes ego can be an obstacle in anyone's life preventing them from becoming better.
7- Automation : I worked as an intern in a software testing company we spent lots and lots of time doing boring repetitive tasks so i always wanted to learn automation
8- Testing : As a software testing engineer, I encountered many types of bugs that can occur in a poorly tested program.
9- Solving problems : I've Heared once a quote that says " Think twice code once ".
10- Consistency : There is a good saying that i love and admire " Consistency over intensity "
